  As Christians, we all have the same challenge: “For the flesh lusts against
  the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one
  another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.” (Gal. 5:17) But
  prior to this Paul writes: “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not
  fulfill the lust of the flesh.” WE DON’T HAVE TO YIELD TO THE FLESH, FOR GOD
  HAS GIVEN US GRACE AND POWER TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT, BUT WE MUST BE WILLING TO
  DO IT HIS WAY AND NOT OUR OWN WAY!

As Christians, we all have the same challenge: "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish." (Gal. 5:17) But prior to this Paul writes: "I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh." WE DON'T HAVE TO YIELD TO THE FLESH, FOR GOD HAS GIVEN US GRACE AND POWER TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT, BUT WE MUST BE WILLING TO DO IT HIS WAY AND NOT OUR OWN WAY!

It's impossible for any of us to change anything in our life unless we are first willing to admit we have a problem and therefore have a need to change. The only reason a person becomes a Christian is they must first admit their own spiritual bankruptcy and dire need for God's grace and forgiveness. Becoming a Christian doesn't happen any other way! Unfortunately, we live in a society that promotes and celebrates denial of one's personal problems and at all costs.....God Forbid.... "Don't feel the need to take responsibility for your own actions....do your best to blame some one else!" The "blame game" goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve.

Any time we try to blame someone else for our own actions, we are lying to ourselves and are refusing to take responsibility for our actions. When was the last time you heard of a business C.E.O. or politician clearly caught doing something ill-legal and they immediately admit they were both guilty and wrong? ALMOST NEVER! Have you ever noticed the whole world seems to be completely innocent?.......NOT!

One of the great things God desires to do in our lives' as Christians is to become REAL! To become transparent! To become genuine! To become honest! To become a person of real integrity and be willing to take full responsibility for our own actions! To "put to death" once and for all the blame-game!

May we all allow God's grace to work in our lives' so that His true character and nature can flow through us!
